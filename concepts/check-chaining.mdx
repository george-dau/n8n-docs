## The composable approach

Worlds provides three fundamental check types that can be combined to express any detection use case:

| Type | Question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [**Type I**](/nodes/type-1-track-in-zone) | Is this track in a zone meeting threshold conditions? |
| [**Type II**](/nodes/type-2-zone-sequence) | Did this track visit zones in a specific order? |
| [**Type III**](/nodes/type-3-track-interaction) | Did this track interact with another track? |

Rather than building specialized nodes for each use case, you compose these types together in your workflow.

## How composition works

Each check type writes its results to a separate namespace — `checks.type1`, `checks.type2`, `checks.type3` — and preserves all input data. This means you can chain them in sequence:

```
Trigger → Type I Check → Type II Check → Event Orchestrator
```

The Event Orchestrator reads the combined `checks` object and evaluates all results using AND or OR logic to decide whether to create, update, or close an event.

## Common compositions

### Type I alone — track in zone

The simplest and most common pattern. A single Type I check handles use cases like:

- Obstruction/loitering (dwell + velocity thresholds)
- Zone intrusion (intersection threshold)
- Speeding in zone (velocity threshold)

```
Trigger → Type I → Event Orchestrator → Event Manager
```

### Type I + Type II — zone sequence with thresholds

Combine zone presence conditions with directional/sequence validation:

- Wrong-way detection with speed check (was the vehicle going fast in the wrong direction?)
- Checkpoint compliance (did the vehicle stop at checkpoint A before entering zone B?)

```
Trigger → Type I → Type II → Event Orchestrator → Event Manager
```

### Type I + Type III — proximity in zone

Combine zone-based conditions with track-to-track interaction:

- Person near forklift in a specific zone
- Two vehicles overlapping in a loading bay

```
Trigger → Type I → Type III → Event Orchestrator → Event Manager
```

### All three types

For complex safety rules:

- Person entered restricted zone (Type I), bypassed the checkpoint (Type II), and was near equipment (Type III)

```
Trigger → Type I → Type II → Type III → Event Orchestrator → Event Manager
```

## Output accumulation

As data flows through multiple check nodes, the `checks` object accumulates:

```json
{
  "track_state": { ... },
  "checks": {
    "type1": {
      "passed": true,
      "matching_zones": ["79"],
      "zone_details": { ... }
    },
    "type2": {
      "passed": true,
      "matching_zones": ["zone_b"],
      "track_sequence": ["zone_a", "zone_c", "zone_b"],
      "sequences": [ ... ]
    }
  }
}
```

The Event Orchestrator evaluates all `checks` entries:

- **AND mode** — all checks must pass for conditions to be met
- **OR mode** — any check passing is sufficient

## Logic within vs. across checks

Understanding the logic layers:

| Level | Logic | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Within a zone** | AND | All enabled thresholds must pass for a zone to match |
| **Across zones** | OR | At least one zone must match for the check to pass |
| **Across check types** | AND or OR | Configured on the Event Orchestrator |

<Tip>
Start with a single Type I check for most use cases. Add Type II or Type III only when your use case genuinely requires sequence or interaction detection. Simpler workflows are easier to debug and maintain.
