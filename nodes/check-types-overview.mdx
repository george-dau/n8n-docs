The Worlds Track Checks node provides three check types that can be composed together to build any detection use case. Each type examines a different aspect of track behavior.

## The three types

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Type I" icon="location-dot" href="/nodes/type-1-track-in-zone">
    **Track in Zone**

    Is a track in a zone meeting threshold conditions?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type II" icon="route" href="/nodes/type-2-zone-sequence">
    **Zone Sequence**

    Did a track visit zones in a specific order?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type III" icon="people-arrows" href="/nodes/type-3-track-interaction">
    **Track Interaction**

    Did two tracks interact with each other?
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Composing use cases

Most real-world detection use cases are compositions of these three types:

| Use Case | Types Used | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Obstruction / loitering | Type I | Track in zone with high dwell time, low velocity |
| Wrong-way detection | Type II | Track visits zones in forbidden order |
| Safety near-miss | Type III | Person track interacts with vehicle track |
| Congestion monitoring | Type I | Multiple tracks in zone exceeding thresholds |
| Unauthorized zone entry | Type I + II | Track enters restricted zone after bypassing checkpoint |
| Person-vehicle proximity in zone | Type I + Type III | Track in specific zone AND interacting with another track type |

## How checks compose

Each check type writes its results to a separate namespace (`checks.type1`, `checks.type2`, `checks.type3`) and preserves all input data. This means you can chain them in sequence:

```
Trigger → Type I Check → Type II Check → Event Orchestrator
```

The Event Orchestrator reads the `checks` object and evaluates all results together using AND or OR logic.

## Common output structure

All three types share the same output pattern:

```json
{
  "track_state": { ... },
  "checks": {
    "type1": {
      "passed": true,
      "matching_zones": ["42", "79"],
      "matching_zone_count": 2,
      "zone_details": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `passed` | Whether the check conditions were met |
| `matching_zones` / `matching_interactions` | Which zones or tracks matched |
| `zone_details` / `interaction_details` | Detailed per-zone or per-interaction results with threshold breakdowns |
| `reason` | If `passed` is false, explains why (e.g., `no_zones_met_all_thresholds`) |

## Auto check target

All check types automatically detect whether to check **active zones** (for streaming/live data) or **historical zones** (for batch/expired tracks) based on the trigger mode. You can override this in advanced settings.
