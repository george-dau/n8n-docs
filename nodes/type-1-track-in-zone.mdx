title: "Type I: Track in Zone"
description: "Check if a track's interaction with configured zones meets threshold conditions"
---

Type I checks evaluate whether a track is present in specific zones and whether its zone interaction metrics (intersection, dwell time, velocity) meet configured thresholds.

## When to use

Use Type I for any use case where the core question is "is this object in this zone doing this thing?":

- **Obstruction / loitering** — dwell time above threshold, velocity below threshold
- **Zone intrusion** — any presence in a restricted zone with minimum intersection
- **Congestion** — multiple tracks in a zone exceeding thresholds
- **Speeding** — velocity above threshold in a zone
- **Stopped vehicle** — velocity below threshold for extended dwell time

## How it works

1. The node reads the track's zone data (active zones for live data, historical zones for expired tracks)
2. For each zone that has a threshold configuration, it evaluates **all enabled thresholds**
3. A zone passes if **all** enabled thresholds pass (AND logic within a zone)
4. The overall check passes if **at least one** zone passes (OR logic across zones)

## Configuration

### Site

Select the Worlds site. This loads the available zones for threshold configuration.

### Threshold groups

Threshold groups define which zones to check and what thresholds to apply. Each group contains:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Zone IDs** | Which zones this group applies to |
| **Intersection** | Minimum overlap between the object's bounding box and the zone polygon |
| **Dwell Time** | How long the object has been in the zone |
| **Velocity** | How fast the object is moving within the zone |

Each threshold has:
- **Enable toggle** — only enabled thresholds are evaluated
- **Operator** — `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `==`
- **Value** — the threshold value

**Threshold units:**

| Threshold | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intersection | % (0–100) | Percentage of bounding box overlapping the zone |
| Dwell Time | seconds | Time spent in the zone |
| Velocity | px/s or m/s | Speed within the zone (pixel or geo-referenced) |

<Tip>
You can create multiple threshold groups to apply different thresholds to different zones. A zone can only belong to one group.
</Tip>

### Advanced settings

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Check Target** | Auto | `auto` detects from trigger mode. Override with `active` or `history`. |
| **Debug Mode** | false | Enable verbose logging |

## Business use case examples

<Accordion title="Obstruction detection — dwell + intersection + velocity">
Detect vehicles (forklifts, tuggers, AMRs) blocking factory aisles. A vehicle is considered an obstruction when it has been in an aisle zone for an extended period with low velocity.

| Threshold | Operator | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Intersection** | `>=` | `10%` | Vehicle bounding box must overlap the zone |
| **Dwell Time** | `>=` | `300s` (5 min) | Vehicle must have been stopped for at least 5 minutes |
| **Velocity** | `<` | `5 px/s` | Vehicle must be stationary or near-stationary |

**Mode:** Batch — only need the track summary after the vehicle leaves.

All three thresholds are enabled, so a zone only passes if all three conditions are met simultaneously. Different aisle zones can share a single threshold group if they have the same criteria, or use separate groups for zones with different dwell time requirements (e.g., loading docks allow longer stops).

See the [Obstruction Workflow](/guides/batch-track-state) guide for the full end-to-end walkthrough.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Failure to stop — velocity only, multiple threshold groups">
Detect vehicles that fail to come to a complete stop at designated stop sign zones. This is a **compliance monitoring** pattern — every vehicle passing through creates an event, either compliant or non-compliant.

| Threshold | Operator | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Velocity** | `<=` | `25–120 px/s` (varies) | Vehicle's average velocity must be at or below the zone's speed threshold |

**Mode:** Batch — only need the track summary after the vehicle passes through.

The key detail: **10 separate threshold groups** with different velocity values. Zones near intersections have lower thresholds (stricter stops), while zones in high-traffic corridors have higher thresholds. Each stop zone is assigned to exactly one group.

A code node downstream preserves the original pass/fail result as `threshold_passed`, then overrides `type1.passed = true` so that **both** compliant and non-compliant tracks flow through to event creation. The event subtype is set dynamically based on the saved result.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PPE zone pre-filter — intersection only">
As a pre-filter in the PPE compliance workflow, Type I determines whether a person is in a designated PPE zone before evaluating whether they're wearing PPE (via a Type III check).

| Threshold | Operator | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Intersection** | `>=` | `10%` | Person must be in a PPE-required zone |

**Mode:** Batch — using person and PPE tags together so interactions are calculated.

Only intersection is enabled — no dwell time or velocity requirements. The check simply answers "is this person in a zone that requires PPE?" Tracks that fail are dropped via an early-exit Switch node before running the more expensive Type III interaction check.

This demonstrates how Type I can be used as a **lightweight filter** in a multi-check composition (Type I → Type III → VLM fallback).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Adapting thresholds for other use cases">
Type I is the most flexible check node — different threshold combinations serve very different use cases:

| Use Case | Intersection | Dwell Time | Velocity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aisle obstruction | `>= 10%` | `>= 300s` | `< 5 px/s` |
| Loading dock overstay | `>= 20%` | `>= 1800s` | `< 2 px/s` |
| No-park zone violation | `>= 10%` | `>= 60s` | `< 3 px/s` |
| Zone intrusion | `>= 5%` | — | — |
| Speeding in zone | `>= 10%` | — | `> 200 px/s` |
| Stop compliance | — | — | `<= 50 px/s` |

The key principle: enable only the thresholds you need for your specific use case. Fewer enabled thresholds means a broader match.
</Accordion>

## Active vs. historical zones

| Check Target | Source | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Active** | `zones.active` | Streaming/live — zones the track is currently in |
| **History** | `zones.history` | Batch/expired — zones the track was previously in |

For historical zones, the node uses **"any entry passes" logic** — if a track visited the same zone multiple times, only one entry needs to pass all thresholds.
