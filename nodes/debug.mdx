description: "Debug and manage event state in the state machine's Redis store"
---

The Debug node provides direct access to event state in the state machine's Redis store. Use it for troubleshooting, testing, and manual state management.

## When to use

- **Troubleshooting** — inspect event state when workflows aren't behaving as expected
- **Testing** — create or delete event state manually to test specific workflow paths
- **Recovery** — force an event into a specific state to recover from edge cases

## Operations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Create Event">
    Create an event entry directly in the state machine's Redis store.

    | Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Scope Type** | Select | track | Entity type: track, zone, device, or site |
    | **Scope ID** | String | — | Scope identifier (e.g., a track UUID) |
    | **Workflow ID** | Expression | `={{$workflow.id}}` | Workflow ID for the event key |
    | **Workflow Name** | Expression | `={{$workflow.name}}` | Workflow name stored with the event |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Get Event">
    Look up an event's current state.

    | Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Scope ID** | String | — | Scope identifier to look up |
    | **Workflow ID** | Expression | `={{$workflow.id}}` | Workflow ID for the event key |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Force State">
    Force an event into a specific state. Use with caution.

    | Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Scope ID** | String | — | Scope identifier |
    | **Workflow ID** | Expression | `={{$workflow.id}}` | Workflow ID for the event key |
    | **Force State** | Select | active | Target state: pending, active, closing, or closed |
    | **Closure Reason** | Select | — | Optional: conditions_not_met, event_timeout, track_expired, manual_close |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Delete Event">
    Remove an event entry from Redis entirely.

    | Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Scope ID** | String | — | Scope identifier of the event to delete |
    | **Workflow ID** | Expression | `={{$workflow.id}}` | Workflow ID for the event key |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

All operations support a **Debug Mode** toggle for verbose logging.

## Credentials

No credentials required. The Debug node communicates directly with the state machine's Redis instance.

<Warning>
The Debug node modifies state machine state directly. Use it for development and troubleshooting only — not in production workflows. Forcing state or deleting events can cause the Event Orchestrator to behave unexpectedly.
</Warning>
