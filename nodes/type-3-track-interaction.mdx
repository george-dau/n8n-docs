title: "Type III: Track Interaction"
description: "Check if a track interacted with other tracks matching tag and threshold criteria"
---

Type III checks evaluate whether a track had interactions with other tracked objects. Interactions are detected by the state machine based on bounding box overlap and proximity, and this node applies tag filtering and threshold conditions.

## When to use

Use Type III for any use case where the core question is "did this object interact with that type of object?":

- **Safety near-miss** — person within dangerous proximity of a forklift
- **Equipment interaction** — two specific vehicle types overlapping
- **Congestion interaction** — tracks of the same type clustering together
- **Escort compliance** — vehicle must be accompanied by a person

## How it works

1. The node reads the track's `interactions` array (populated by the state machine in batch mode)
2. It matches the **primary tag** (current track's object type) against configured groups
3. For matching groups, it checks the **secondary tag** (interacting track's object type)
4. If both tags match, it evaluates threshold conditions (overlap, duration, distance)
5. The check passes if **at least one** interaction meets all enabled thresholds

### Tag matching

Type III uses a two-tag system:

| Tag | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary tag** | The object type of the current track | `person` |
| **Secondary tag** | The object type of the interacting track | `forklift` |

A threshold group only applies when **both** the primary and secondary tags match.

## Configuration

### Interaction threshold groups

Each group defines a tag pair and optional thresholds:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Primary Tags** | Object type(s) of the current track (e.g., person) |
| **Secondary Tags** | Object type(s) of the interacting track (e.g., forklift, vehicle) |
| **Overlap** | Minimum bounding box overlap percentage (0–100%) |
| **Duration** | Minimum interaction duration in seconds |
| **Distance** | Maximum distance between tracks (pixels or meters) |

Each threshold has an enable toggle, operator (`>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `==`), and value.

<Note>
If no thresholds are enabled, the check passes on **tag match alone** — any interaction between the configured tag types will pass.
</Note>

### Debug mode

Boolean toggle for verbose logging.

### Key output fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `passed` | Whether any interaction met all thresholds |
| `primary_tag_matched` | Whether the current track's tag matched any group's primary tags |
| `matching_interactions` | Track IDs of interacting tracks that passed |
| `matching_track_pair_ids` | Canonical pair IDs (sorted alphabetically) for deduplication |
| `matching_tags` | Object types of matching interacting tracks |
| `interaction_details` | Per-interaction threshold breakdown |
| `reason` | If failed: `primary_tag_not_configured`, `no_interactions_in_input`, `no_interactions_met_thresholds`, etc. |

### Track pair IDs

Type III generates canonical track pair IDs by alphabetically sorting the two track IDs. This ensures the same pair always produces the same ID regardless of which track is primary:

```
track-a::track-b  (always this order, never track-b::track-a)
```

This is useful for deduplication when both tracks in a pair trigger the same workflow.

## Business use case examples

<Accordion title="PPE compliance — person + PPE bounding box overlap">
Detect whether workers are wearing high-visibility safety vests in designated PPE zones. The CV model detects both `person` and `ppe` objects — if a person's bounding box overlaps with a PPE detection, they're wearing it.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Primary Tags** | `person` |
| **Secondary Tags** | `ppe` |
| **Overlap** | Enabled, `>= 1%` |
| **Duration** | Not enabled |
| **Distance** | Not enabled |

**Mode:** Batch — the trigger must include **both** `person` and `ppe` object types so the state machine calculates interactions between them.

The overlap threshold is intentionally low (1%) because any bounding box overlap between a person and a PPE detection indicates the person is wearing the equipment. When the check fails (no PPE overlap found), the workflow routes to a **VLM fallback** — a Vision Language Model analyzes the image for a second opinion before flagging a violation. This reduces false violations when the CV model misses a PPE detection.

<Note>
The trigger must include all relevant object types for interactions to be calculated. If you only include `person`, the state machine won't track `ppe` objects and no interactions will appear.
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vehicle collision / near-miss — proximity between tracks">
Detect when vehicles come dangerously close to each other or to pedestrians. This uses the proximity thresholds rather than overlap.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Primary Tags** | `person` (or vehicle types) |
| **Secondary Tags** | `forklift`, `vehicle`, `tugger` |
| **Overlap** | Not enabled (or enabled for actual collisions) |
| **Duration** | Enabled, `>= 2s` |
| **Distance** | Enabled, `<= 50 px` |

**Mode:** Batch — the trigger includes all relevant object types.

For near-miss detection, you typically care about **proximity** (how close they got) and **duration** (how long they were close). For actual collision detection, you'd enable **overlap** instead. The `matching_track_pair_ids` output is critical for deduplication — since both tracks in a near-miss may trigger the workflow, the canonical pair ID ensures you only create one event per interaction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Adapting for other use cases">
Type III threshold combinations serve different interaction scenarios:

| Use Case | Primary | Secondary | Key Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PPE compliance | `person` | `ppe` | Overlap `>= 1%` |
| Near-miss | `person` | Vehicle types | Distance `<= 50 px`, Duration `>= 2s` |
| Vehicle collision | Vehicle types | Vehicle types | Overlap `>= 10%`, Duration `>= 1s` |
| Escort compliance | `vehicle` | `person` | Distance `<= 100 px`, Duration `>= 30s` |
| Tailgating | `vehicle` | `vehicle` | Distance `<= 30 px` |

Remember: if no thresholds are enabled, the check passes on **tag match alone**. Always enable at least one threshold to filter meaningful interactions.
</Accordion>

## Batch mode requirement

Type III checks require **interaction data** which is only available in **batch mode**. The state machine calculates interactions (bounding box overlap, proximity) when processing batch subscriptions. Streaming mode does not include interaction data.

## Credentials

No credentials required. Tag options are configured manually.
