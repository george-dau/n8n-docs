title: "Replay Trigger"
description: "Replay historical track detections for testing workflows without live camera feeds"
---

The Replay Trigger lets you test workflows using historical detection data. It replays past tracks through the state machine, producing the same signals (`track_created`, `track_updated`, `track_expired`) as live detections.

## When to use

- **Testing workflows** before deploying to production
- **Debugging** a specific track that caused unexpected behavior
- **Developing** new workflows without needing access to live cameras
- **Demonstrating** workflow behavior to stakeholders

## Data source modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Track ID">
    Replay specific tracks by their UUIDs. Use this when you have a known track you want to re-process.

    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Track IDs** | Text (multiline) | UUIDs of tracks to replay |
    | **Timestamp** | DateTime | Approximate time when track occurred. Required for tracks older than 24 hours. |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Query">
    Search for tracks by time range, data source, zone, and object type. Use this to replay a broader set of activity.

    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Site** | Select | Site to query |
    | **Data Sources** | Multi-select | Cameras to query tracks from |
    | **Zones** | Multi-select | Specific zones to filter by |
    | **Tags** | Multi-select | Object types to include |
    | **Start Time** | DateTime | Start of time range (UTC) |
    | **End Time** | DateTime | End of time range (UTC) |
    | **Max Tracks** | Number | Maximum tracks to fetch (default: 100) |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Processing modes

Like the Detection Webhook Trigger, the Replay Trigger supports both **streaming** and **batch** processing modes.

In streaming mode, you can choose between **auto** replay (tracks are replayed with original timing preserved) or **manual** replay (step through detections one at a time).

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Processing Mode** | Select | Streaming | Streaming or Batch |
| **Signal Type** | Select | Track State | Track State or Zone State (streaming only) |
| **Mode** | Select | Auto | Auto or Manual replay (streaming only) |
| **Cleanup Events** | Boolean | true | Delete events created during replay when complete |
| **Debug Mode** | Boolean | false | Enable verbose logging |

## Output

The output format is identical to the [Detection Webhook Trigger](/nodes/detection-webhook-trigger). Your workflow doesn't need to know whether data is live or replayed — the same check nodes, orchestrator, and action nodes work with both.

## Credentials

Requires **GraphQL Subscription API** credentials.

<Tip>
Keep the Replay Trigger in your workflow but **disable it** when running live. This gives you an easy way to test at any time by disabling the live trigger and enabling the replay trigger.
