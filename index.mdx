description: "Build automated detection workflows using Worlds custom nodes for n8n"
---

Build workflows that turn real-time computer vision detections into automated actions — events, alerts, emails, and more.

## How it works

Every workflow follows the same three-step pattern:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Inject detection data">
    A **Trigger Node** receives real-time track and zone data from the Worlds detection pipeline via the state machine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply business logic">
    **Check Nodes** evaluate conditions — is the object in a specific zone? Has it been there long enough? Is it moving too slowly? Chain checks together to build precise rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take action">
    **Event and Action Nodes** create events in the Worlds UI, capture images, generate GIFs, send email alerts, and more.
  </Step>
</Steps>
