## Requirements

Before building workflows with Worlds custom nodes, you need:

### Worlds Platform Access

- An active Worlds account with access to your organization's sites and cameras
- **GraphQL API credentials** — a Token ID and Token Value pair for authenticating with the Worlds API
- At least one site with configured zones and active camera feeds

### n8n Instance

- A running n8n instance (self-hosted or Docker) with the Worlds custom nodes installed
- The **n8n state machine** service running and connected to your Redis instance
- Network connectivity between n8n, the state machine, and the Worlds API

### Credentials configured in n8n

You need to set up these credential types in your n8n instance:

| Credential | Required for | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GraphQL Subscription API** | All Worlds nodes | GraphQL URL, WebSocket URL, Token ID, Token Value |
| **SendGrid API** | Email notifications | API Key, Sender Email, Sender Name, Template ID, Environment |
| **Redis API** | Detection buffering (if applicable) | Host, Port, Password, Database |

### Setting up GraphQL credentials

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** → **Add Credential**
2. Search for **GraphQL Subscription API**
3. Fill in:
   - **GraphQL URL**: Your Worlds API endpoint (e.g., `https://your-instance.worlds.io/graphql`)
   - **WebSocket URL**: The WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `wss://your-instance.worlds.io/graphql`)
   - **Token ID**: Your authentication token ID
   - **Token Value**: Your authentication token value
4. Click **Test** to verify connectivity, then **Save**
